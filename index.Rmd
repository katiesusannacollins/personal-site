## Molluscs and morphometrics

I'm a molluscan paleontologist who works on a variety of projects centred on systematics, form and function. I specialise in bivalves but I'm not averse to dabbling in the odd snail, which works nicely with my current role as the Curator of Benthic Molluscs in the Invertebrates and Plants Paleobiology department of the Earth Sciences Division at the Natural History Museum, London.
